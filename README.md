TCOSY-System
============

I have created this system for a University Club.

Its purpose is to assist in keeping records of members.

This is a prototype and structure has not been finalised.

Main files can be found in src folder, package nz.ac.massey.tcosy.PersonelSystem

Running Main.java will allow you to operate the system through console inputs.
A GUI is planned for the future.
